## Development server

To run this project, locally, you need to have npm installed so you can fetch dependencies using npm i.

If you don't have Angular CLI installed, you can run npm run start, which will open the server locally, on port 4200.

Otherwise, simply, run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
